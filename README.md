# Code Refactor Code

## Description
This project is for a marketing agency that requires a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.

The page has a header that contains navigation to the different sections on the page. There is a hero section after the header with a background image. Below that, there are sections (which the navigation at the top would take you to) listing what the marketing agency does. To the right of that is a section listing the benefits. Then there is a footer at the bottom of the page. All the the image elements have accessible alt attributes.
